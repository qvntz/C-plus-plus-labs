# Iterators

1) Simple examples of how iterators and lambda functions work **(easy)**
2) Splitting words by space using iterators **(easy)**
	* The idea of the solution is to iteratively search for the next space in the string. Once it is found, its position sets the end of the next word that can be added to the answer. The search for the next space will continue from the next position.
3) Deleting duplicates **(easy)**
